The programmer has completed all of the requirements for the Client/Server programming
assignment. The programmer inclued two outputs given that he did not know if his higher up
wanted the program to return the sentence fully reversed or just reversed with the letters
still facing the proper way.(Reverse is ambiguous) The programmer did the assignment quickly
with the help of the TCPServer/TCPClient java file provided by Dr.An. However, I learned that
the placement of the (while) loop in the creation of the server played a major roll in the
output that the user views.
